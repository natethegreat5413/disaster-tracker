# Disaster Tracker

This project was based off of of a TraversyMedia tutorial demonstrating how to use Google maps for React.

## Personal Touch

The tutorial was originally supposed to be a wildfire tracker only displaying wildfires across the world, but researching the Nasa API, which was used in the project I was able to give it my own touch with these additions:

- Added markers for Volcanoes, Storms, and Icebergs.
- Not every tracker has description information, but I was able to conditionally render it so the ones that do have info, you're able to see it when clicked on.
- Further styling on the icons to make them more readily available and easier to click on.

## Technology/Tools Used

• React
• CSS
• google-map-react
• iconify
• NASA API
